# Signals and Systems Generating Sound

## Briefing:
Since frequencies are very important in today's world, it was constantly examined and many famous
people have assisted with the establishment of today's analyzation tools needed to improve technology
which does not only span music and it's industry.

This project looked at the frequencies of musical notes. These musical notes is not restricted only to
what is listened to, but also to what is heard everyday. In this project, certain frequencies were 
used to recreate any original audio.

- virtualenv
- scipy
- tkinter

If all prerequisites are fulfilled skip to execution of code.
#### Installation of pre-requisites (Linux Machines [Debian/Ubuntu Systems])
1. If python3 isn't installed on your machine, use your package manager to install it.
